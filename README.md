# Weather data

I have been downloading  observation data from the [Metoffice datapoint service](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/datapoint) in JSON format for a number of years now. After trying to decode the data with R and Python, I finally settled on using HIVE running on a [Hadoop cluster](https://uliharder.wordpress.com/r/hadoop-on-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/). Long term my plan is to explore using mySQL as the latest version also copes with JSON documents and the setup is simpler than Hadoop. Using trial and error I found that this [table definition](createTableWeatherRawPartioned.sql) interprets the data correctly, it uses this [JSON SERDE](https://github.com/rcongiu/Hive-JSON-Serde). 

The processing is done steps, first importing and keeping the raw data in a staging table. Then the interpreted data is kept in a table that is still partitioned by the download date but the format is no longer JSON. The last step keeps the data partitioned by day of observation using a sliding window over the downloading dates. The window should be big enough to ensure we do not lose data with our `INSERT OVERWRITE`.

The regular ingests create a plot for observations from the station in Benson.

## Raw data ingest

The  script [`createTableWeatherRawPartioned.sql`](createTableWeatherRawPartioned.sql) creates a HIVE table
that can hold the JSON observations we have been downloading daily over
the last few years. We populate it with the script [`addFile.sh`](addFile.sh) one at
a time. This would be faster by copying all files for one day in one
go. 

## First processing step

The script [`createTableWeatherProcessed.sql`](createTableWeatherProcessed.sql) creates a table that
holds the observations as text rather JSON but keeps the partitioning by
download day. The ingest is done by [`ingestRawWeather.sh`](ingestRawWeather.sh). 

## Final processing step

In the next step the data is kept in a table created by
[`createTableWeatherPartitioned.sql`](createTableWeatherPartitioned.sql) and the partitioning is done by
day of observation. To get the `INSERT OVERWRITE` right and avoid
deleting data we pick an observation day, write its partition and look
at the files downloaded two days before and afer. This is done in the script [`ingestProcessedWeather.sh`](ingestProcessedWeather.sh).

## Regular downloads

The script [`pipeline.sh`](pipeline.sh) puts the data regularly into HDFS and HIVE. It is triggered by a simple crontab command.

## A plot of the latest data  

To keep an eye on the progress of the processing pipeline we plot the last 7 days of weather for the stats in Benson with the R script [`makeGraph.R`](R/makeGraph.R). It uses the line `options(bitmapType='cairo')` to be able to plot in the background. The data has been coloured by the time of the day (period).
